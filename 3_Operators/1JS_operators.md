## Javascript Operator

Operator are for Mathemation and Logical computaions

The **Assignments Operator**  `=` assigns values
The **Addition operator**     `+` add values
The **Mutiplication**         `*` multipes values
The **Comparison Operator**   `>` compares values

### Javascript Assignment

The **Asssignment operator `(=)` assigns a value to a variable:

***Example***

```
   let x = 10;
```

```
   // Assign the value 5 to x
   let x = 5;

   // Assign the value 2 to y
   let y = 2;

   // Assign the value x + y to z
   let z = x + y;
```

### Javascript addition

The addition operator `(+)` adds numbers:

***Example***

```
   let x = 5;
   let y = 2;
   let z = x + y;
```

### Javascript Multiplication

The mutiplication operator `(*)` multiplies number:

***Example***

```
   let x = 5;
   let y = 2;
   let z = x * y;
```

### Types of javascript operators

There are differfnt types of javascript operators:
   - Arithmetic operators
   - Assignment operators
   - Comparison operators
   - Logical operators
   - and more ...

### Javascript arithmetic operators

**Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:

***Example***

```
   let a = 3;
   let x = (100 + 50) * a;
```

| Operator | Description |
|---|---|
|    +     |   Addition                      |
|    -     |   Subtraction                   |
|    *     |   Mutiplication                 |
|    **    |   Exponention                   |
|    /     |   Division                      |
|    %     |   Modulus (Divison remainder)   |
|    ++    |   Increment                     |
|    --    |   Decrement                     |

### Javascript String addiion

The `+`  can also be used to add (concatenate) string:

***Example***

```
   let text1 = "John";
   let text2 = "Doe";
   let text3 = text1 + " " + text2; // John Doe
```

The `+=` assignment operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings:

***Example***
